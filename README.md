# Practical Coding Exercises

> DSA problems aren't what programmers do all day!

Ok, yeah. This is true. No one seems to disagree with that.

But what if you still want practice problems
that DO reflect the kind of things programmers do every day? 
That's where PCE comes in. I have built a collection of practical
coding exercises that somewhere are in-between Leetcode-style abstract
problems and building a complete application which may not give you enough
exposure to different types of challenges. These will work for hiring code challenges as
most are desgined to be completed in an hour or two, or for more advanced exercises, in four
to five hours.

There are currently eight categories:
* data processing and transformations
* error handling and validation
* async and performance
* state management
* caching and storage
* stream processing and events
* API design and integration
* protocol implementations

Projects:

Also included are five different major projects that will take more time:
* Build an express-style web framework
* 

## Rules
1. No AI, write your own code
2. No external libraries. No lodash, no axios.
3. Exercises are from easiest to hardest starting at 0

The current solutions are not necessarily optimized as I wrote
them all myself without the use of AI and I am not necessarily
the best at optimizations. But most of them are manipulating in-memory
data structures where optimizations are generally a waste of time. If you think
you have a much better solution, particularly one that is more readable, please 
submit a PR

If you find any errors, please feel free to open a GH issues.

**In the meantime, happy coding**
