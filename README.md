#Practical Coding Exercises

> DSA problems aren't what programmers do all day!

Ok, yeah. This is true. But what if you still want practice problems
that DO reflect the kind of things programmers do every day? 
That's where PCE comes in. I have built a collection of practical
coding exercises that somewhere are in-between Leetcode-stlye abstract
problems and building a complete application which may not give you enough
exposure to different types of challenges.

Right now the exercises are all in Node.js but I plan to build out
the Python ones as well. I will accept pull requests for other languages
too, and I may do Go once I get there.


If you find any errors, please feel free to open a GH issues.

In the meantime, happy coding
